Medical AI is not only about achieving high accuracy it must also be reliable, transparent, and clinically trustworthy.
 As part of a Deep Learning case study in healthcare, I worked on building an uncertainty-aware and explainable chest X-ray disease detection system.

Problem Statement

 Chest X-rays are widely used in diagnosis, yet they present major challenges:
 • Subtle disease patterns are difficult to distinguish
 • Deep learning models often act as black boxes
 • False positives and false negatives can directly impact patient care
This project encouraged us to go beyond raw performance and focus on confidence, interpretability, and clinical relevance.

Tech Stack:
Python, PyTorch, Vision Transformer (ViT), CNNs, Grad-CAM, Computer Vision

Description:

Developed a deep learning–based chest X-ray classification system using Vision Transformers to classify COVID-19, pneumonia, lung opacity, and normal cases.

Integrated Grad-CAM–based explainability to highlight disease-relevant regions, improving interpretability and trust in model predictions.

Evaluated performance using ROC curves, confusion matrices, and classification reports to ensure reliable multi-class diagnostic assessment.
