# Chest-Disease-Detection-using-DL-Interpretable-Vision-Transformer-Pipeline-for-Medical-Imaging-
Developed a deep learning–based chest X-ray classification system using Vision Transformers to classify COVID-19, pneumonia, lung opacity, and normal cases.  Integrated Grad-CAM–based explainability to highlight disease-relevant regions, improving interpretability and trust in model predictions.
